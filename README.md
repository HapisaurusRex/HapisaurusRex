- 👋 Hi, I’m @HapisaurusRex
- 👀 I’m interested in mechanical engineering, cooking, and making idiot proof instructions (partially inspired by cooking)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of website creation and algorithms but I want to delve into software engineering and see what I can really get a computer to do

- 💞️ I’m looking to gain experience by doing my own projects (because my code would probably not be up to other expectations yet) Check out my progress !

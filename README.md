- 👋 Hi, I’m @HapisaurusRex
- 👀 I’m interested in mechanical engineering, cooking, and making idiot proof instructions for computers to do stuff for me
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of website creation and algorithms but I want to delve into software engineering and see what I can really get a computer to do

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that people will let me contribute to
